# Python Screening Task 2: AI Debugging Assistant Prompt

This repository contains my submission for the Python Screening Task 2, which involves crafting a prompt for an AI to assist students with debugging their Python code without providing the direct solution.

## Prompt

The prompt for the AI assistant is located in the prompt.md file.

## Reasoning

My design choices for this prompt focus on creating an effective and educational debugging tool.

Tone and Style: The AI's tone is designed to be patient, helpful, and encouraging. It avoids direct answers and instead uses a Socratic style of questioning to guide the student.

Balance of Guidance: The AI balances identifying a bug with guiding the student by:
- Internally pinpointing the core issue.
- Translating that finding into a single, non-spoiler question or hint.
- Briefly explaining the underlying concept without connecting it directly to the student's code.
